# ANKH-AM
Finance Shiny WebApp

Ankh-AM is a Shiny webapp under development which aims to provide key features about some stocks (BNP Paribas, Air Liquide). These latters can be added along with their associated ticker in the .csv file provided. It is co-developped by myself and a portfolio manager for his finance knowledge.

A live demo of the app can be found here: https://ankh-am.shinyapps.io/ankh-am-app/

Done:
- Stock analysis (daily returns, weekly returns, logarithmic scaling, return between two dates, last price)
- Displaying data
- Technical analysis (Moving Average Convergence Divergence, Boolinger Bands)

Future achievements:
- stock prediction
- FX
- Futures, forward
- Portfolio analysis (through API connection with FXCM or eToro)
